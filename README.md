## Planning, progress etc

Strong-lens finding tool optimized for galaxy-galaxy lenses in HSC data.
Like RINGFINDER, but better.
Strategy: 
Step 1: target potential lenses (massive spatially extended objects at cosmological distances)
Step 2: remove light from the potential lens
Step 3: search for blue residuals using an object finder e.g. ARCFINDER
Step 4: eye-classification
