% Change log
%
% v3.0 May 2015
%    Renamed to match the new package name
%    Version number matches mnras.cls
%    A few minor tweaks to wording
% v1.0 September 2013
%    Beta testing only - never publicly released
%    First version: a simple (ish) template for creating an MNRAS paper

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Basic setup. Most papers should leave these options alone.
\documentclass[a4paper,fleqn,usenatbib]{mnras}

% MNRAS is set in Times font. If you don't have this installed (most LaTeX
% installations will be fine) or prefer the old Computer Modern fonts, comment
% out the following line
\usepackage{newtxtext,newtxmath}

% Depending on your LaTeX fonts installation, you might get better results with one of these:
%\usepackage{mathptmx}
%\usepackage{txfonts}

% Use vector fonts, so it zooms properly in on-screen viewing software
% Don't change these lines unless you know what you are doing
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{ae,aecompl}

% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
We developed a method to look for galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses in photometric data. We applied it to the first internal data release of the HSC SSP survey. We found $\ngradeA$ definite lenses, Y probable lenses and Z possible lenses.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Introduction}

Lenses are great.

\section{The Data}

\subsection{HSC photometry}
The HSC survey is great.

\subsection{BOSS spectroscopy}
BOSS is great.

\section{The Method}

Method overview.

\subsection{Light subtraction}

\subsection{Lensed image identification}

\subsection{Foreground model}

\subsection{Lens model}

\subsection{Non-lens model}

\subsection{Tests on the SL2S sample}

\section{The photometrically selected sample}

\subsection{Candidate grading}
We graded lens candidates output by YattaLens according to their likelihood of being strong lenses, $\plens$, using the following scheme:
\begin{itemize}
\item Grade A: definite lenses ($\plens > 0.997$), 
\item Grade B: probable lenses ($0.5 < \plens < 0.997$)
\item Grade C: possible lenses ($0.003 < \plens < 0.5$)
\item Grade 0: non lenses ($plens < 0.003$)
\end{itemize}

\section{The spectroscopically selected sample}

\section{Results}
In \Fref{fig:gradeA} we show the grade A lenses.
