Fits parametrized light profiles to multi-band data in a Bayesian framework.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quick start:

Add the yattalens directory to your PYTHONPATH.

in the directory 
example/
running 'python fit_deV_profile.py'
will fit a de Vaucouleurs profile to the light profile of a strong lens, as observed from CFHT.

Name of input files (science exposure, uncertainty, psf) are hard-written in the file fit_deV_profile.py

The code will look for a mask file (0s on pixels to be used in the fit, 1s on pixels to be excluded), but will proceed anyway if it can't find it.

Initial guesses for the model parameters are input in the dictionary 'guess'.
The units of centroids and effective radius are pixels.

The speed of the code is mostly set by the convolution. Increasing the size of the psf will slow down the code.

The code will produce an output deVauc.txt file with the best fit values of the parameters.
It will also produce a *resid.fits file for each band.
These files have multiple extension: ext 0 is the residual, ext 1 is the residual normalized by the uncertainty, ext 2 is the model.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Known issues:

- If the initial guess for the PA is off by a lot, spasmoid can get stuck at very round values for the axis ratio parameter 'q'.
